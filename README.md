# Superscalar-Risc-V
An attempt at making a pipelined, superscalar Risc V processor. An attempt at out of order instruction execution as well. I can already see this going poorly. Finally have time to work on this so I will finally start making substantial process. 
See the wiki for more info.
Sorry for any technical mistakes, using this project to learn how computers work so I don't already know this stuff.
Let me know if you have any suggestions/questions/tips :)
