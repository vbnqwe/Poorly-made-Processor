2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell ordering_reg[1][0]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) ordering_reg[1][0]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell ordering_reg[1][1]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) ordering_reg[1][0]/PRE, ordering_reg[1][1]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell ordering_reg[1][1]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) ordering_reg[1][1]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#4 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell ordering_reg[2][1]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) ordering_reg[2][0]/CLR, ordering_reg[2][1]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
