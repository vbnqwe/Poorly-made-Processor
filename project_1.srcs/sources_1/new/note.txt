create 2 queue data  structures
	-a1 will be for storing data of instruction
	-a2 will be for storing how many cycles until commit

On each cycle:
	-decrement a2 values all by 1
	-pick up to 4 which have 0 cycles left
		-if more than 4 ready, set remainder to have 1 cycle left (aka stall)
	-set completed registers to the 4 values picked along with their respective address
	-add new instructions visited into the a1 and a2 queues
	-repeat

End when queue is empty and all instructions have been visited
